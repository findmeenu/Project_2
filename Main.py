Ahmed ! Let's include coin tossing to decide who will play first.
#if head appears then player one and tail then player 2.
Both the one-die (Neller and Presser11) and the two-dice (Zhu and Ma13) sequential Pig games have 
indicated that the player who plays first has certain advantage in term of the winning probability. 
The sequential setting is unfair to those played at the end of the playing queue, especially when the number of players increases.
